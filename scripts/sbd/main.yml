shortdesc: "SBD, Shared storage based fencing"
longdesc: |
  Create a SBD STONITH resource. SBD must be configured to use
  a particular shared storage device using /etc/sysconfig/sbd.

  You need to configure an SBD resource for each node to manage.

  There is quite a bit more to do to make this stonith operational.
  See http://www.linux-ha.org/wiki/SBD_Fencing for information, or
  the sbd(8) manual page.

parameters:
  - name: id
    shortdesc: The resource id (name)
    example: stonith-sbd
    required: true
    type: resource
  - name: node
    shortdesc: The node id that this stonith resource manages.
    required: true
    type: resource
  - name: sbd_device
    shortdesc: Name of the device (shared disk)
    longdesc: >
      NB: Make sure that the device remains the same on reboots. It's
      preferable to use udev generated names rather than the usual
      /dev/sd?
    type: string
    required: true

actions:
  - cib: |
      primitive {{id}} stonith:external/sbd
        params sbd_device="{{sbd_device}}"
        op monitor interval=15s timeout=60s
        op start timeout=60s
