Features

. Audit

	- add user auditing, i.e. save all commands that were run
      (DONE: see the -R flag)

	- save to a local file (distributed DB would probably be an
	  overkill)

. Cluster documentation

	- one of the more recent features is graph capability
	  (graphviz) which is a very good step in terms of cluster
	  documentation; need to extend that with some textual
	  cluster description and perhaps history and such

	- everybody likes reports (and in particular your boss)

	- this feature needs very careful consideration

. CIB features

    - Support ACL commands in Pacemaker 1.1.12>
      (DONE)

. Command features

    - Relative commands: /status from configure, ../resource stop foo
      from configure, cib/new from configure... for example.

      Tricky part: Have to push/pop levels invisibly, resource
      commands modify CIB while CIB is edited in configure. Similar
      races could occur with other commands.
