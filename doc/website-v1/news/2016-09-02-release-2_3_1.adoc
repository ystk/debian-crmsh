Hello everyone!

Today I am releasing crmsh version 2.3.1. The only change this time is
to lower the Python version requirement from 2.7 to 2.6. This is so
that crmsh remains compatible with centOS 6, where there is no
standardized Python 2.7 version available. For users of other
distributions where Python 2.7 is available, there are no other
changes in this release and no need to upgrade.

The source code can be downloaded from Github:

* https://github.com/ClusterLabs/crmsh/releases/tag/2.3.1

Packages for several popular Linux distributions can be downloaded
from the Stable repository at the OBS:

* http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/ha-clustering:/Stable/

Archives of the tagged release:

* https://github.com/ClusterLabs/crmsh/archive/2.3.1.tar.gz
* https://github.com/ClusterLabs/crmsh/archive/2.3.1.zip

As usual, a huge thank you to all contributors and users of crmsh!

Cheers,
Kristoffer
